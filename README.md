# Mini Clone of Redis 

This is a simple TypeScript Redis clone that I built for fun and practice. It runs on Node.js and allows you to perform basic operations such as set, get, and delete.

## Features

This is a mini version of the real thing, with just enough features. Here's what it can do:

- `set`: To set a value, simply use `set key value`
- `get`: To get a value, use `get key`
- `delete`: To delete a value, use `delete key`

That's pretty much it, folks! No need to worry about the complexity of the original Redis, this clone will do just fineðŸ™„.
